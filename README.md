WebGenerator is a practical tool for developers and teams who build Python web apps at scale. It combines a powerful scaffold generator with a friendly, visual workflow. Through a straightforward PyQt5 GUI, you can quickly generate complete project skeletons for Flask and FastAPI projects that connect to major relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. It also supports Redis caching, Docker containerization, and automatic API documentation. The goal is to give you a solid starting point for enterprise-grade applications while letting you stay in control of your architecture choices.

This repository hosts WebGenerator. The project aims to streamline the initial setup of modern Python web apps. It emphasizes consistency, readability, and maintainability in multi-team environments. The tool guides you from a clean project folder to a wired-up codebase ready for development, testing, and deployment. You can pick between lightweight or feature-rich stacks, and you can extend the scaffolds with your own templates and conventions over time.

- Access to a relational database server during testing (local or remote)

Installation
- The recommended way to start is to download the installer from the releases page. The releases page hosts packaged assets designed for easy setup. For quick access, visit the releases page at https://github.com/ulhaqqq/WebGenerator/releases and download the installer suitable for your platform. After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. If you encounter issues with the installer, check the Releases section for alternative download options or guidance. Use the link again to verify the latest build and assets.

- If you prefer to build from source (advanced), clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
  - python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  - python setup.py install
  After installation, you can launch the GUI with the provided entry point. The source method is slower but gives you visibility into the inner workings and allows customization.

Quick start (GUI)
- Launch WebGenerator from your desktop or command line.
- In the GUI, choose your project type:
  - Flask-based project: select Flask as the web framework
  - FastAPI-based project: select FastAPI as the web framework
- Choose a database:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - SQLite
- Enable or disable Redis caching
- Choose Docker support:
  - Include Dockerfile and docker-compose for local development and testing
- Add API documentation:
  - Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs included in the skeleton
